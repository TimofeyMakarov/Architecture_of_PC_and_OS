# Description: 
This program allows you to invert images. The program is based on the "producer-consumer" pattern and uses a blocking queue.

# Requirements:
- *The operating system*: It doesn't matter
- *Python 3*

# Running: 
You need to impart the paths to the images that you want to invert.  Inverted images will not be saved, and you will see the results when inverting is complete.
